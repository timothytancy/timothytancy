## About Me
I am a recent Data Science and AI graduate from Nanyang Technological University. I have a strong interest in exploring the applications of deep learning to solve everyday problems.

## Projects
- Implemented image augmentation strategies for a semi-supervised image segmentation technique (FixMatch). [Link](https://github.com/timothytancy/SSL4MIS) to repo. 
- Implemented generated soft targets to improve action recognition networks (STGCN). [Link](https://github.com/timothytancy/mmaction2) to repo. 

## Open to Opportunities
I am actively seeking job opportunities in the field of Machine Learning/AI, as well as software engineer roles. I am also interested in learning more about Web3/Blockchain technologies.

## Open-Source Contributions
I have contributed to the [SSL4MIS](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS) repository for medical image segmentation.
